# CountIt
Information:
Postgraduate Studies Project.
We wanted to make budget management application for renovation.
It was my first project with external Backend.
This project requires PHP web server. 
I suggest to install Xampp or Apache Lounge with external DB like MySQL for example.
I personally prefer Apache Lounge, because I used to use MySQL for other projects.
